    <h1>About the Data</h1>
    <p> Our dataset comes from Data.gov and provides a comprehensive overview of electric vehicles registered across Washington State. The original dataset contains 18 columns and will be filtered down to approximately 10,000 rows for analysis. It includes detailed information such as the make and model of each vehicle, its electric range, city and county of registration, eligibility for clean alternative fuel incentives, and more. This level of detail makes the dataset especially well-suited for our topic, as it allows us to explore not only geographic patterns in EV adoption but also insights into policy impacts and technological trends. Overall, the dataset is well-rounded and thorough, with minimal missing information, making it a strong foundation for our analysis.
