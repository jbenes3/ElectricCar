    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Our project will provide a comprehensive look at the growing adoption of electric vehicles across the state of Washington. As the nation shifts toward sustainable energy solutions, understanding EV trends is crucial for policymakers, urban planners, and businesses. Our project hopes to offer valuable insights into the distribution of all EV characteristics - where they are located, which ones are more common, etc. By analyzing this data, we can assess the impact of government incentives, infrastructure development, and consumer preferences on EV adoption. This topic is particularly relevant to the state as well as the country as a whole as society moves toward reducing carbon emissions thru expanding EV access, making it an exciting and essential area for analysis.</p>

    <h1>About the Data</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Our dataset comes from <strong>Data.gov</strong> and focuses on electric vehicles registered in Washington State.</li>
        <li>The original dataset contains <strong>18 columns</strong> and will be filtered to around <strong>10,000 rows</strong> for analysis.</li>
        <li>It includes detailed attributes such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Make and model of each vehicle</li>
                <li>Electric range</li>
                <li>City and county of registration</li>
                <li>Eligibility for clean alternative fuel incentives</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The dataset allows us to explore:
            <ul>
                <li>Geographic patterns in EV adoption</li>
                <li>Policy impacts</li>
                <li>Technological trends</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It has <strong>minimal missing data</strong>, making it reliable for deep analysis.</li>
    </ul>
