    <h1>Summary & Insights</h1>
    <p>Our visualizations show several important patterns in how electric vehicles (EVs) are being adopted across Washington State. The data makes it clear that EV use is not spread out evenly. Instead, it is mostly concentrated in specific counties, electric utilities, and popular car brands. One county that clearly stands out is King County, which holds 50.63 percent of all EVs in the state. This high number may be due to a mix of factors, such as more charging stations, higher population, stronger local policies, and more people who are ready to make the switch to electric. When we look at the vehicles themselves, we can see that the electric range of newer EVs has improved a lot over time. Starting around 2018, new models began offering much longer ranges, which helps explain why more people are interested in buying EVs now. The bar chart made with D3 shows this trend clearly. It gives an easy way to explore how EV technology has improved year by year, especially when it comes to how far the cars can go on a single charge. Popular car brands also play a big role in the growth of EVs. Tesla is a clear leader, with models like the Model 3 and Model Y appearing in counties all over the state. The Sankey diagram shows this well by mapping how each brand and model is spread out across Washington. Teslaâ€™s wide reach shows its strong brand and appeal to many types of drivers. Overall, the visualizations help explain both where EVs are most common and why those places are leading. From a policy and planning point of view, this information can help identify areas that need more support or investment. It also shows that strategies working in places like King County could be useful in other parts of the state. In the future, it would be helpful to look at how these numbers change over time, or to compare Washington to other states to see how it fits into the national picture of EV growth.
