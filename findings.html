    <h1>Summary & Insights</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>EV adoption is concentrated in specific areas:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>EV usage is not evenly distributed across the state.</li>
                <li><strong>King County alone accounts for 50.63%</strong> of all EVs in Washington.</li>
                <li>This may be due to a combination of factors like more charging stations, higher population density, stronger policies, and greater public interest in EVs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Electric range has significantly improved over time:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Since 2018, new EV models offer much longer electric ranges.</li>
                <li>This increase in range helps explain the growing popularity of EVs.</li>
                <li>The D3 bar chart clearly shows this improvement in technology year by year.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Tesla dominates EV adoption across the state:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y appear in counties all across Washington.</li>
                <li>The Treemap diagram maps out the widespread presence of Tesla vehicles.</li>
                <li>This highlights Tesla’s strong brand influence and broad appeal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Policy and planning implications:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The visualizations identify areas that could benefit from additional EV infrastructure or incentives.</li>
                <li>Strategies from successful areas like King County could be adapted for other regions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Future directions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzing how EV distribution changes over time could provide better insights.</li>
                <li>Comparing Washington’s trends with other states could show how it fits into the national picture.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
