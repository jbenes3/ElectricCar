    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Our project will provide a comprehensive look at the growing adoption of electric vehicles across the state of Washington. As the nation shifts toward sustainable energy solutions, understanding EV trends is crucial for policymakers, urban planners, and businesses. Our project hopes to offer valuable insights into the distribution of all EV characteristics - where they are located, which ones are more common, etc. By analyzing this data, we can assess the impact of government incentives, infrastructure development, and consumer preferences on EV adoption. This topic is particularly relevant to the state as well as the country as a whole as society moves toward reducing carbon emissions thru expanding EV access, making it an exciting and essential area for analysis.</p>

    <h1>About the Data</h1>
    <p>Our dataset comes from Data.gov and provides a comprehensive overview of electric vehicles registered across Washington State. The original dataset contains 18 columns and will be filtered down to approximately 10,000 rows for analysis. It includes detailed information such as the make and model of each vehicle, its electric range, city and county of registration, eligibility for clean alternative fuel incentives, and more. This level of detail makes the dataset especially well-suited for our topic, as it allows us to explore not only geographic patterns in EV adoption but also insights into policy impacts and technological trends. Overall, the dataset is well-rounded and thorough, with minimal missing information, making it a strong foundation for our analysis.</p>
